# ðŸ§  Local RAG Pipeline with LangChain + Ollama + Chroma

This project is a lightweight Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system that allows you to:

- âœ… Load PDFs from a directory  
- âœ… Chunk and embed them using LangChain and ChromaDB  
- âœ… Query the vector DB using natural language  
- âœ… Get grounded answers from a local LLM (Ollama)  
- âœ… Automatically evaluate responses against expectations
